    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of
        the Maratha Empire.<br> It was
        supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after<br> the completion of the base floor or the first story,
        the
        people of Satara (the national capital) complained to <br>
        the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone
        monument can be sanctioned and built
        only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas.<br> Following this, an
        official letter was written to <br>the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and
        not
        stone
    </p>


    <h3>Gates in Shaniwar_wada</h3>
    <p>
        1.<b>Delhi Darwaza</b>
        The Delhi Darwaza is the main gate of the complex, and faces north towards Delhi. In fact, Shaniwar Wada is
        the<br>
        only fort structure in India to have its main gate facing Delhi, the medieval imperial capital of Mughal
        Empire.<br>
        Even Chhatrapati Shahu is said to have considered the north-facing fort an indication of Baji Rao's
        ambitions<br>
        against the Mughal Empire, and suggested that the main gate should be made of chhaatiiche, maatiche naahi!<br>
        (Marathi for "of the chests of brave soldiers, not made of mud").<br>
        The strongly built Delhi Darwaza gatehouse has massive doors, large enough to admit elephants outfitted with<br>
        howdahs (seating canopies). To discourage elephants charging the gates, each pane of the gate has
        seventy-two<br>
        sharp twelve-inch steel spikes arranged in a nine by eight grid, at approximately the height of the forehead
        of<br>
        a battle-elephant. Each pane was also fortified with steel cross members, and borders were bolted with steel<br>
        bolts having sharpened cone heads. The bastions flanking the gatehouse has arrow-loops and machicolation
        chutes<br>
        through which boiling oil could be poured onto offending raiders. The right pane has a small man-sized door
        for<br>
        usual entries and exits, too small to allow an army to enter rapidly. Shaniwar Wada was built by a
        contractor<br>
        from Rajasthan known as 'Kumawat' of the Vadar Sub-caste, after completing construction they were given the
        name<br>
        'Naik' by the Peshwa.[citation needed]<br>
        Even if the main gates were to be forced open, a charging army would need to turn sharply right, then
        sharply<br>
        left, to pass through the gateway and into the central complex. This would provide a defending army with
        another<br>
        chance to attack the incoming army, and to launch a counterattack to recapture the gateway.<br>
        As the ceremonial gate of the fort, military campaigns would set out from and be received back here, with<br>
        appropriate religious

        <img src="../img/places/Agakhan2.jpg" height="300" width="200"><br>
        <b>Location:</b> Pune, Maharashtra, India<br>
        <b>Coordinates:</b>18.5523°N 73.9015°E<br>
        <b>Area:</b> 7.7 hectares (19 acres)<br>
        <b>Built:</b> 1892; 132 years ago<br>
        <b>Governing body:</b> Gandhi National Memorial Society<br>

        <h3>History</h3><br>
        <p>

            Historically, the palace holds great significance. Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi and his
            secretary<br>
            Mahadev Desai were interned in the palace from 9 August 1942 to 6 May 1944, following the launch of Quit
            India<br>
            Movement. Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai died during their captivity period in the palace and have
            their<br>
            Samadhis located over there. Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi have their memorials located in the same<br>
            complex, near Mula river.[5] Legend goes that the Sultan built the palace to provide employment to the
            famine<br>
            struck villagers of the surrounding region; so he employed 1000 people, and the palace was constructed in
            five<br>
            years. It was built in Rs 12 lakhs. The total area is 7.7 hectares (19 acres) and built up palace covers
            2.8<br>
            hectares (6.9 acres), and the rest is a well maintained garden.[citation needed]<br>

        <h1>सारसबाग/Sarasbaug</h1><br>
        <img src="../img/places/Sarasbag2.jpg" height="300" width="200">,<br>

        <h3>History</h3><br>
        <p>
            Saras Baug was built in the 20th century around the temple which was built in the mid-18th century in the
            middle<br>
            of a lake that once existed in Pune. The idea of building a Ganesh Temple near the Parvati Temple was<br>
            conceptualised by Nanasaheb Peshwe. The construction began in 1750 and was completed 34 years later, in
            1784.<br>

            Between the 18th and the 19th century, the temple was used by the Marathas as a meeting point to carry
            out<br>
            military strategy discussions. They made tactical plans against the British and the Nizams. It is said that
            the<br>
            Marathas would sail in boats to the Ganesh Temple in the middle of the lake and, for complete privacy, the
            boats<br>
            were steered by Native Africans because they would not understand a word of Marathi.<br>

            The temple and Saras Baug has undergone renovations several times in these years. One of these renovations
            was<br>
            done around 1842, assisted by the East India Company. There was another major revamp in 1969 which was<br>
            supervised by Anand Rao Mane and Mahadev Kumthekar. The Peshwe Park Zoo was also relocated in 1999. It
            took<br>
            about 6 years to do so and, in 2005, all the animals were transferred to the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park.
            Also,<br>
            in 1995, a museum dedicated to Lord Ganesha was built inside the premises.<br>

        <img src="../img/places/sinhagadfort.jpg" height="300" width="200">

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>

            Sinhagad fort, whose earlier name was Kondana or Kondhana, stands 20kms, south-west of Pune. Perched on
            an<br>
            isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range of the Sahyadri Mountains, its height above sea-level is 1380
            metres.<br>
            Given natural protection by its very steep slopes, the walls and bastions were constructed at only key
            places;<br>
            it has two gates – the Kalyan Darwaza in the south-east and the Pun Darwaza in the north-east<br>

            Sinhagad fort has a long history. It was captured from theKoli tribal chieftain, Nag Naik, by Muhammad
            bin<br>
            Tughlaq in 1328 AD. Three centuries later, Shivaji wrested it away by bribing the commander, by the Treaty
            of<br>
            Purandar (1665 AD) had to cede the fort to the Mughals. Sinhagad fort was the scene of one of the most
            daring<br>
            exploits in Maratha history when, in 1670 AD, it was recaptured by Shivjaji’s forces under Tanaji Malusare,
            who<br>
            laid down his life in the battle. On his death, a saddened Shivaji said, “The fort is won, but the lion
            is<br>
            gone!” Whereupon the fort got is new name: Sinha (lion) gadha (fort). Finally the British seized the fort
            from<br>
            the Peshwas in 1818 AD, destroying its almost all ancient monuments. Only the traditional gates and broken
            walls<br>
            remain now.

            The upper surface of the fort is undulating and retains few buildings, Ruins of temples, tombs and towers
            are<br>
            scattered about. Near the gorge is a monument (Samadhi) commemorating the bravery of Tanaji. There is also
            a<br>
            tiny tomb of Rajaram, Shivaji’s son, who die<br>
